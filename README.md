# Pirates Team 
Git introduction tutorial for the Pirates team :)

## Introduction
In this repository i will give an introduction about what we are going to work with and how we do it.

## Forks :
After joining the pirates team you will see on the top right something called fork.

**Frok:** will bring the Repository to your profile so that you can work from you space.

## Issues :
Issues are imporatant to create somethings that we need to implement or even if you want to eat kebap :D

Make sure to assign to yourself the issue that you are going to work with so that the others will know on what you are working with.

## Pull request:
Lets you explain to the others about the changes the you pushed to the ropo, once you opend a pull request you can discuss 
you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators (the team) and add follow-up commits
before the changes are merged into the repository.

## Projects
I will separate them into 3 columns : Drag and Drop

To Do | In progress | Done
---   | ---         | ---   
The issues that we need to do| The issue that you are working with right now |The issue that you finished it

## Merge 
In merge, we will merge the pull requset into the upstream branch (*the main branch not in the main repo*)

## Command-lines
``` 
git clone <url-set>
git remote add origin <url-set>
git add <files name that you want to upload>
git commit -m "message"
git push // or you can do --> git push -u origin master
```

To pull the changes that the other done it
```
git fetch *remote-name* --> remote name is *origin* most of the time.
git merge *remote-name/branch-name* // this git merge is combines your local changes with changes made by others.
git pull *remote-name* *branch-name* // notce the space between the remote name and branch name
```
*additional Command lines*

If you want to work on other branch do this
``` 
git branch <branch-name>
git checkout <branch-name>
```
